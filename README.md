# lazycrate

TUI for crate management like lazydocker and lazynpm.
Shouldve named it as lazycargo but lazycrates sounded good at that time.

TODO:
- [ ] important: add checks (eg. Cargo.toml exists?, or any fields in it)
- [ ] better parsing toml file.
- [ ] implement basic stuff like in lazynpm.
- [ ] add an actions module.
- [ ] a popup api (maybe for help pages for the curr panel)
- [ ] add user config options.
